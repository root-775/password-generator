# Password Generator App

A React-based application to generate secure, customizable passwords and manage them efficiently. Users can configure password complexity, length, and save generated passwords to a backend API.

## Features
- **Password Generation**
  - Customizable password length (1â€“100).
  - Options to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
  - Multiple complexity modes:
    - **Easy to Say**: Avoids ambiguous characters.
    - **Easy to Read**: Excludes visually similar characters.
    - **All Characters**: Includes all character types.

- **Password Management**
  - Save generated passwords with a custom type.
  - View a list of saved passwords, including metadata (type, complexity mode, creation date).
  - Delete saved passwords.
  
- **Clipboard Integration**
  - Copy generated passwords to the clipboard with a single click.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with functional components and hooks.
- **Backend**: API integration via Axios (API endpoints must be set in `.env` as `REACT_APP_API_URL`).
- **Styling**: CSS for responsive and user-friendly design.
- **Icons**: React Icons (e.g., `MdDelete`) for actions.
- **Notifications**: SweetAlert2 for alerts and feedback.
